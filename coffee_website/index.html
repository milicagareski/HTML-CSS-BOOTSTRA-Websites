    <h2 class="heading">Etimology</h2>
    <p> Though coffee is now a global commodity, it has a long history tied closely to food traditions around the Red Sea. The
earliest credible evidence of coffee drinking in the form of the modern beverage appears in modern-day Yemen from the
mid-15th century in Sufi shrines, where coffee seeds were first roasted and brewed in a manner similar to current
methods. The Yemenis procured the coffee beans from the Ethiopian Highlands via coastal Somali intermediaries and began
cultivation. By the 16th century, the drink had reached the rest of the Middle East and North Africa, later spreading to
Europe. In the 20th century, coffee became a global commodity, creating different coffee cultures around the world.All coffee plants are classified in the large family Rubiaceae. They are evergreen shrubs or trees that may grow 5 m (15
ft) tall when unpruned. The leaves are dark green and glossy, usually 10–15 cm (4–6 in) long and 6 cm (2.4 in) wide,
simple, entire, and opposite. Petioles of opposite leaves fuse at the base to form interpetiolar stipules,
characteristic of Rubiaceae. The flowers are axillary, and clusters of fragrant white flowers bloom simultaneously.
Gynoecium consists of an inferior ovary, also characteristic of Rubiaceae. The flowers are followed by oval berries of
about 1.5 cm (0.6 in).[41] When immature, they are green, and they ripen to yellow, then crimson, before turning black
on drying. Each berry usually contains two seeds, but 5–10% of the berries[42] have only one; these are called
peaberries.[43] Arabica berries ripen in six to eight months, while robusta takes nine to eleven months.[44]

Coffea arabica is predominantly self-pollinating, and as a result, the seedlings are generally uniform and vary little
from their parents. In contrast, Coffea canephora, and C. liberica are self-incompatible and require outcrossing. This
means that useful forms and hybrids must be propagated vegetatively.[45] Cuttings, grafting, and budding are the usual
methods of vegetative propagation.[46] On the other hand, there is great scope for experimentation in search of
potential new strains.[45]

    <h2 class="heading">History</h2>
    <p> 
        There are multiple anecdotal origin stories which lack evidence. In a commonly repeated legend, Kaldi, a 9th-century
        Ethiopian goatherd, first observed the coffee plant after seeing his flock energized by chewing on the plant.[9] This
        legend does not appear in Arab sources before 1671, indicating the story is likely false.[9] Another legend attributes
        the discovery of coffee to a Sheikh Omar. Omar, starving after exiled from Mocha, found berries. After attempting to
        chew and roast them, Omar boiled them, which yielded a liquid that revitalized and sustained him All coffee plants are classified in the large family Rubiaceae. They are evergreen shrubs or trees that may grow 5 m (15

    <p> 
  Several species of shrub of the genus Coffea produce the berries from which coffee is extracted. The two main species
  commercially cultivated are Coffea canephora (predominantly a form known as 'robusta') and C. arabica.[38] C. arabica,
  the most highly regarded species, is native to the southwestern highlands of Ethiopia and the Boma Plateau in
  southeastern Sudan and Mount Marsabit in northern Kenya.[39] C. canephora is native to western and central Subsaharan
  Africa, from Guinea to Uganda and southern Sudan.[40] Less popular species are C. liberica, C. stenophylla, C.
mauritiana, and C. racemosa.All coffee plants are classified in the large family Rubiaceae. They are evergreen shrubs or trees that may grow 5 m (15
